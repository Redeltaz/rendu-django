First install all packages with :
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
<br>

Run the migrations :
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
<br>

You can now launch the app :
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
The app will be listening on `127.0.0.1:8000` by default. <br><br>
All apps are available on routes `/exemple`, `shop`, `/chat`
